# RobotControl

Arduino ESP8266 project for UBTech Alpha 1S Controller.

Initial version 1.0 comes from the sample in my UBTech library.

Versionn 2.0 will define a new set of communization protocol.
In this version, it will support both V1 & V2 commands.


## Major changes in V2

- New V2.0 communication protocol to avoid misinterpretation
  (some V1 commands are kept for bluetooth control)
- Support control from USB, Bluetooth and Wifi (connect to router or AP mode)
- Action setup by reading position from robot
- Convert action from UBT action file in aesx and hts format
- Play MP3 with action
- Use MPU 6050 to detect current situation
- Define the action to stand up after fall down for both face up & face down cases
- Touch sensor and response for single, double and triple click, and long touch.
- ...


## Dependency

And also online update firmware up to 921600bps, it takes less than 10 seconds to flash the firmware.

You need a ESP8266 control board in order to use this firmware.

You can make a simple PCB like this,

I just make one as below, I have removed the HC-05 as it can already controlled by smartphone via WiFi.

and this is my testing environment for program development, including PSX Control and Ultrasonic Sensor.

Or if you cannot make the PCB yourself, you can buy a ready to use control board from Taobo.
